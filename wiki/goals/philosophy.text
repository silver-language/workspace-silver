The philospohy of silver, if there is one, is simply that of claims or assertions.

You simply claim that something-is-something - and that's more or less it.


But, and to be upfront, this also means that silver does *not* claim or assume some things, such as:

	Everything is an object
	Everything is a function

Which are both rather weightier claims I think.
