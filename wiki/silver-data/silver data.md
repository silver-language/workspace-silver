Beginning
---------

This is where we start, silver is at it heart a data format.

It basically allows you to make claims, or statements, or assertions.


Simple things like
```
	foo: 1
```
or
```
	foo:
		a
		b
		c
```
As such its structure is one of keys and values.

All silver files are data files, and can be parsed into structure trees.
