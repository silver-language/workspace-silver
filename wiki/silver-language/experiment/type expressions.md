Type Expressions
================


I've seen a few different kinds of type expressions in different languages, but I don't know any of them really well.
Will probably have to do a bit of a refresher of what's out there and what I might need.


Off the top of my head here are some things that might be required or useful:

* exact type matches - must have the same type name
* synonymous type - where types have equivalent shapes, but not names
* compatible types - where types have the same shape in some subset of features
* subtypes, including equal or subtype
* AND - pairs, tuples, records
* OR - choice, enumeration, sum,
* unions
* intersections
*
