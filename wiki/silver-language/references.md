		I think the ampersand is there so that you can write a context-free parser for CSS. Otherwise a parser would need a potentially "infinite lookahead" to determine if an expression inside a rule block is a the beginning of a rule or a child selector. Personally I've seen syntax far worse than this in other languages (I'm looking at you, Apple, you mutant alien enemy, for calling interfaces "protocols" and unions "enums").

		Nesting style rules naively inside of other style rules is, unfortunately, ambiguousâ€”the syntax of a selector overlaps with the syntax of a declaration, so an implementation requires unbounded lookahead to tell whether a given bit of text is a declaration or the start of a style rule.
