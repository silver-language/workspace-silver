Silver
======


Silver Data
-----------

This is where we start, silver is at it heart a data format.

It basically allows you to make claims, or statements, or assertions.

Simple things like

	foo: 1

or

	foo:
		a
		b
		c

As such its structure is one of keys and values.

All silver files are data files, and can be parsed into structure trees.



Silver Language
---------------

Silver language is an additional layer on top of the data format.

It allows for defining programming grammars in silver data that can be used for writing programs.
