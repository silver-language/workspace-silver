			He makes lots of points I agree with, though his example code at t=2302 is something I don't much like.

A very good video on music notation by Tantacrul
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq3bUFgEcb4

	Discusses evolution, density, expansion, alternative notations
	Standard western music notation is a series of compromises made over time, though not all good.
	In effect they apply a kind of 'compression' to the music information.
	Alternative notations are less compressed in different ways (readability is subjective), or apply to specific kinds of music.

	The analogy to computer languages is how much of of the languages basic rules are compressed into it's syntax.
	Should programming languages be fully expanded to make them more readable?
	Could a universal fully expanded language be created?
