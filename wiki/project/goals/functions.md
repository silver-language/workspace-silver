Types/properties

	pure
	has side-effects

	input type - domain
	ouput type - codomain (type) or image (allowed values)

	associative
	commutative

	?invertable

	injective:
		every input has a unique output
		no collapse in codomain;
		there may be unmapped members in codomain
		codomain > image (can be)
	surjective:
		every output is mapped to an input
		image covers complete codomain;
		image = codomain (manadatory)
	bijective
		(?isomorphic/isomorphism) - both injective and surjective
		reversable
		1:1 complete unique mapping
