The philospohy of silver, if there is one, is simply that of claims or assertions.

You simply claim that something-is-something - and that's more or less it.


But this also means that silver does *not* claim or assume some things, such as:

	Everything is an object
	Everything is a function
	Everything exists on a computer

Which are more opinionated claims (OOP, FP, C et al).

I suppose if there is more concrete claim it's that everything is data.
