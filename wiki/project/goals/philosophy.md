Philosophy
==========

The philosophy of silver, if there is one, is that of claims or assertions.

You claim that something-is-something, probably give it a useful name, and that's the gist of it.

This also means that silver does *not* claim or assume some things, such as:

* Everything is an object
* Everything is a function
* Everything exists on a computer
* Everything is maths

Which are more opinionated claims (OOP, FP, C, some physics).

More concretely I suppose the claim could be that everything is data.
