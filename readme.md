Workspace for Silver ðŸœ›
======================


This is where all the non-coding work for Silver lives.


See the [wiki](./wiki/) for the current state of knowledge.

See the [task](./task/) folder for things I'm currently working on.

See the [journal](./journal/) for things I'm currently thinking about.




Note on Markdown
----------------
~~For markdown fenced code blocks I'm using `yaml` highlighting as it's the most superficially similar to silver and gives acceptable results in most cases.~~

Github does *not* like my (ab)use of `yaml` so currently [looking for an alternative](<task/github syntax highlighting.md>).
