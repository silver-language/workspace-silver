Workspace for Silver
====================

This is where all the non-coding work for Silver lives.


See the [wiki](./wiki/wiki.md) for the current state of knowledge.

See the [task](./task/task.md) folder for things I'm currently working on.

See the [journal](./journal/journal.md) for things I'm currently thinking about.




Note on Markdown
----------------
For markdown fenced code blocks I'm using `yaml` highlighting as it's the most superficially similar to silver and gives acceptable results in most cases.
