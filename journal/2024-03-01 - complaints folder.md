Complaints Folder
=================

This the the complaints folder.

In here feel free to post:

* whinges, rants and moans
* snark and sarcasm
* petulant name-calling
* scurrilous accusations
* wild consiracy theories
* ill-considered brainfarts

Perhaps you'll feel better.


However...
----------

Once unburdened, turn it into something constructive.

If the complaint can move up the heirarchy it might be useful.
