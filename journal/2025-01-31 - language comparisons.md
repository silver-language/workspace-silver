Language Comparisons
====================

I'm constantly comparing Silver to other languages made by much smarter people than me, to see how they've done things, what's good and not-so-good.

The main languages I'll be comparing against are those that are well established, ones that I have some knowledge of, or that are seen to be forward looking.

Primary Languages (no order):
* Go
* JavaScript and TypeScript
* Python
* Rust
* C#
* Java

I have very little knowledge of C or C++ so they'll be taking a back seat.

Data and markup formats:
* JSON
* XML
* Markdown
* YAML
