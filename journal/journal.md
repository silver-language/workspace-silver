Journal
=======


Process
-------

* If it has a definable endpoint/outcome open a task instead
* If the aim is discovery/discussion/braindump open a journal entry
* Journal files must be datestamped so they sort naturally
* Journals should express a brief-ish burst of thought. A given journal entry shouldn't be open for much more than a week or two before it should to be closed
* Work it to a satisfactory (enough) resolution, then close it
* Once a journal entry is closed it shouldn't get major edits, maybe just tidies for typos, egregious errors, and forwarding notes to other relevent documents.
* Journal entries may or may not produce results
* Revisiting a journal entry means opening a new journal entry with a link to the original.
* Summarize relevent findings in the wiki

History prior to 2025
---------------------
The journal folder is new in 2025, but I've moved in a bunch of old documents that felt like they belonged here for posterity (retroactive journalling).

The dates have been cobbled together from git history, but it's a bit of a mess as there were a few different repos that were split and merged early on, and the edit history on some of these is a bit scattered.

So the early dates are only roughly indicative in many cases, and some are really out of order.
