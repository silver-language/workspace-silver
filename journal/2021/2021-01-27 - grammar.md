I've been reading more about lexing and parsing, and it might be worth it to define the grammar for silver more formally.

I kind of know what i want, but writing it down more clearly will me write the code more clearly.


	literal=
		| string
		| integer
		| float
		| boolean



	terminator =
		newline

	assignmentSeparator =
		:


	assignment
		(identifier assignmentSeparator)? value terminator


	value =
		| literal
		| block


	block
		(
			assignment
		)*
		(
			blockTerminator
		)?


So I might still be mixing up a couple of ideas here, but that's the general idea.
To be more specific i'd need to add in two block definitions - one for indented one for delimited.
Also need to add two new values to specify what can go in what:


	block =
		|	block-indent
		|	block-delimit


When we're in delimited mode:

	block-delimited =
		block-open
		(assignment)*
		block-close

	value =
		| literal
		| block-delimited				// NB delimited blocks can ONLY contain other delimited blocks

	terminator =
		;

When we're in indent-mode:


	indent-string =
		tab


	block-indent =
		(
			indent-string assignment
		)*
		(
			block-close
		)?

	terminator =
		newline

	value-indent =
		|	literal
		|	block						// NB indented blocks can have EITHER indented or delimited blocks



So that's sorta-kinda the grammar.
I might have made an error in enforcing that a terminator be part of an assignment, not sure yet.
It might be part of lexing, not parsing, but not sure yet.
