Why

Why is this here?
-----------------

The original reasons for Silver aren't particularly good.
Mostly it was frustration and ignorance on my own part.
See the [Complaints Folder](./2024-03-01%20-%20complaints%20folder.md) for some examples.

So I wanted to make a language that was easy to read and had a kind of structural consistency.



Who is this for?
----------------

### Primarily: me

Mainly to see if I could make something that had the advanced stuff I was seeing in modern languages, but critically was also pretty easy to read.

I might be a bit programming language dyslexic.
When I see too many brackets, my eyes glaze over while my brain tries to untangle them.
A lot of modernised languages have gotten rather bracket heavy.

But it's not just programming languages - I have the same untangling problem when faced with other dense notations - maths, music, complicated diagrams, foreign languages.
Some of those are best learnt young so you can spend the rest of your life mastering them.
If you're a bit older though, simpler things have lower opportuntity cost.


### Secondarily: anyone else who might be a bit like me

Maybe you're an old fart. Maybe a student. Maybe you feel like there are gaps in your knowledge and postgrad isn't an option.

Possibly you're bit over fads and cool jargon.

Maybe you're AS or ADHD or dyslexic.
