Symbol for silver
=================

I keeep staring at Kalzium trying to think of of cool chemistry-ish symbol for silver.

No need, this unicode character will do, plus I like it:

Out of curiosity I started poking around and it seems like the crescent-moon symbols for silver are much more common in old alchemical texts.
Looking through the unicode links on the wiki page above so far I've only found one reference to the ðŸœ› symbol.
It got added to unicode so someone must have thought it was a good idea.
Perhaps they wanted a symbol whose *primary* meaning was 'silver'; the quarter moons in unicode only list alchemical silver secondarily as alias.
Not sure yet.
