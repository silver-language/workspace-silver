Convert to Library
==================

Fairly sure my integration tests weren't working as expected becuase i was still using a binary (main.rs) crate setup.
Have decide to convert to library, which silver-data should be anyway.

More info on cargo's dir structure (lib/binary) here:

Convert to library
------------------
Okay have a basic conversion going in a branch.

Moved most of main.rs into the bin directory, left the mod structure in lib.rs

Thoughts:
	not keen on making all of the modules public everywhere - need to figure that out better
	not sure i should be using PathBuf in most places, probably should be regular Path instead
	not really sure what should go into the lib.rs file now...
