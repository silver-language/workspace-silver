General Cleanup
===============

The wiki folder is a mess. And some other things.

```yaml
type: task
status: nearly done
blocks: making this repo public
priority: high
```


* Many left over discussion files that aren't needed anymore - some can be moved to completed or active tasks, others just deleted.
* Move certain files between silver-data and silver language
* Remove/update redundant sections of silver-language where homed in silver-data
* Remove inline discussion/discovery to tasks
* Tone down colloquial language, make a bit more neutral



Goals
-----
The wiki should look more like an actual wiki - a place to find current state of knowledge.
In other words it should be *normative*

Lots of docs got dumped in there that shouldn't have - discovery, discussion opinion etc.
Most of those should have been plain old tasks.

I'd like a process something like this in future:
* Open a discovery/discussion/decision task
* Tasks must be finishable - if it has no well-defined conclusion it's not a task
* Work it to a satisfactory (enough) resolution
* When satisfied, move the task to done and summarize the findings in the wiki.

In a handful of cases it might be worth retaining original scripts as something like essays, but they're mostly pretty rough.
Proper essays should be properly edited and properly constructed.


Threshold for publication?
--------------------------

* Old discussion pieces moved out or cleaned up
* A proper wiki-like page for Silver
* Main topics have proper landing pages
* Specific topics have clear and concise summaries, plus examples
* There are relevant links between pages

If I can hit those, I'll consider making the repo public on GitHub.


A third category?
-----------------
I've started cleaning out the wiki, looking a bit better.
Most of the old stuff has either been deleted, moved to done, or moved into the task/inactive folder.

But some of it doesn't quite naturally fit in as tasks.
They're more sort of discovery/exploratory pieces, but not necessarily with a natural resolution.
It depends a bit, and they're mostly pretty poor quality, but I'm wondering if some might belong to a third category, something like a journal or blog.
(Of those I prefer journal.)
I've been wondering about this in other contexts too.


A Journal
---------
If I added a journal folder it would work something like this:
* Journal files would have to be datestamped so they sorted naturally, and could be filed away by year or whatever
* They could be more informal and discussion-like
* Needn't *necessarily* be working towards some specific outcome (unlike tasks), but could certainly generate results.
* Should probably express a brief-ish burst of thought. For example a given journal entry shouldn't be open for much more than a week or so (if even that long) before it needs to be closed.
* Once a journal entry is closed it shouldn't get major edits, maybe just tidies for typos, egregious errors, and forwarding notes to other relevant documents.
* Revisiting a journal entry or idea means opening a new journal entry with a link to the original.


I'm going to give this a crack - even some of my current tasks would probably be better suited as journal entries.


Revised Process with Journals
-----------------------------

* If it has a definable endpoint/outcome open a task
* If the aim is discovery/discussion/braindump open a journal entry
* Work it to a satisfactory (enough) resolution
* Journal entries may or may not produce results
* When done summarize relevant findings in the wiki



Wrapup
------
This look like it's working so far.
Have moved a stack of junky old documents to the journal folder for posterity, a few of which I'll mine for useful ideas.
Some old 'tasks' (that weren't really) have been moved there as well.
The wiki is looking cleaner and I've started making it more prescriptive/normative.
