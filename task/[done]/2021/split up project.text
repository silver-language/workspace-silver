Split up into libs, packages, crates, modules etc

https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html


Sections i want separated:

	file reading/writing
		this should probably be fairly run-of-the-mill actually

	rendering systems
		turning data structures of various kinds into strings

	parsing
		creating data structures from strings
