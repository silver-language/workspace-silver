Read directory with filters
===========================

Have spent a fair bit of time on this - reading directories in rust can be quite difficult.

Have a basic version of it going, but it's pretty crufty/non-idiomatic.

Will likely need a lot of rewriting once I figure out how it's supposed to be done.
