silver data
===========


Split up main into different tasks
	time to start building up a command suite, eg for
		various testing tasks
		parsing
	Ultimately though silver-data is probably better as a library.




Change terminology in a lot of places from 'file' to 'source' - the file analogy will break down fast in other contexts.
