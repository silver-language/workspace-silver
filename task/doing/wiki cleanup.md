Wiki Cleanup
============

The wiki folder is a mess.

```yaml
type: task
status: ongoing
blocks: making this repo public
priority: high
```


* Many left over discussion files that aren't needed anymore - some can be moved to completed or active tasks, others just deleted.
* Move certain files between silver-data and silver language
* Remove/update redundant sections of silver-language where homed in silver-data
* Remove inline discussion/discovery to tasks
* Tone down colloquial language, make a bit more neutral



Goals
-----
The wiki should look more like an actual wiki - a place to find current state of knowledge.

Lots of docs got dumped in there that shouldn't have - discovery, discussion opinion etc.
Most of those should have been plain old tasks.

I'd like to aim for something like this in future:
* Open a discovery/discussion/decision task
* Work it to a satisfactory (enough) resolution
* When satisfied, move the task to done and summarize the findings in the wiki.

In a handful of cases it might be worth retaining original scripts as something like essays, but they're mostly pretty rough.
Proper essays should be properly edited and properly constructed.


Threshold for publication?
--------------------------

* Old discussion pieces moved out or cleaned up
* A proper wiki-like page for Silver
* Main topics have proper landing pages
* Specific topics have clear and concise summaries, plus examples
* There are relevent links between pages

If I can hit those, I'll consider making the repo public on GitHub.
