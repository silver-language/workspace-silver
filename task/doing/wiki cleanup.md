Wiki Cleanup
============

The wiki folder is a mess.

```yaml
type: task
status: ongoing
blocks: making this repo public
priority: high
```


* Many left over discussion files that aren't needed anymore - some can be moved to completed or active tasks, others just deleted.
* Move certain files between silver-data and silver language
* Remove/update redundant sections of silver-language where homed in silver-data
* Remove inline discussion/discovery to tasks
* Tone down colloquial language, make a bit more neutral



Goals
-----
The wiki should look more like an actual wiki - a place to find current state of knowledge.
In other words it should be *normative*

Lots of docs got dumped in there that shouldn't have - discovery, discussion opinion etc.
Most of those should have been plain old tasks.

I'd like a process something like this in future:
* Open a discovery/discussion/decision task
* Tasks must be finishable - if it has no well-defined conclusion it's not a task
* Work it to a satisfactory (enough) resolution
* When satisfied, move the task to done and summarize the findings in the wiki.

In a handful of cases it might be worth retaining original scripts as something like essays, but they're mostly pretty rough.
Proper essays should be properly edited and properly constructed.


Threshold for publication?
--------------------------

* Old discussion pieces moved out or cleaned up
* A proper wiki-like page for Silver
* Main topics have proper landing pages
* Specific topics have clear and concise summaries, plus examples
* There are relevent links between pages

If I can hit those, I'll consider making the repo public on GitHub.


A third category?
-----------------
I've started cleaning out the wiki, looking a bit better.
Most of the old stuff has either been deleted, moved to done, or moved into the task/inactive folder.

But some of it doesn't quite naturally fit in as tasks.
They're more sort of discovery/exploratory pieces, but not necesarily with a natural resolution.
It depends a bit, and they're mostly not very high quality, but I'm wondering if some might belong to a third category, something like a journal or blog.
(Of those I prefer journal.)
I've been wondering about this in other contexts too.

A Journal
---------

If I added a journal folder it would work something like this:
* Journal files would have to be datestamped so they sorted naturally, and could be filed away by year or whatever
* They could be more informal and discussion-like
* Needn't *necessarily* be working towards some specific outcome (unlike tasks), but could certainly generate results.
* Should probably express a brief-ish burst of thought. For example a given journal entry shouldn't be open for much more than a week or so (if even that long) before it needs to be closed.
* Once a journal entry is closed it shouldn't get major edits, maybe just tidies for typos, egregious errors etc.
* Revisiting a journal entry or idea means opening a new journal entry with a link to the original.


I'm going to give this a crack - even some of my current tasks would probably qualify as journal entries.
