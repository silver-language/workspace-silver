Clean up silver workspace
=========================

This is already in progress.

Basic jobs:

*	convert the old thoughts repo into a workspace structure
*	add in the old tasks from the rust-dev machine
*	start organising the old thoughts stuff into a proper wiki
*	convert files to markdown

Wrapup
------
This is mostly done, the rest is just just proper wikification, that's being done on a as-needed basis, so can close this here.
